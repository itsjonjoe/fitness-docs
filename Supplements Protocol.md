## ⚖️ Absorption & Interaction Guidelines
- **Fat-soluble supplements** (Shilajit, Omega-3, D3/K2) → always take with meals containing fat.  
- **Stimulants (Ginseng, Shilajit)** → AM only to protect sleep quality.  
- **Minerals (Zinc, Magnesium)** → separate intake to maximize absorption.  
  - Zinc → after dinner.  
  - Magnesium → right before bed.  
- **Cognitive stack (Lion’s Mane + Ginseng + Shilajit)** → synergistic when taken together in the morning.
