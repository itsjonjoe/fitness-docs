## **1.0 Mission Directive**

The Diet Protocol is the nutritional engine of Project Viking. This protocol is designed to maintain an enhanced caloric deficit (~635 calories daily) while ensuring adequate protein intake for muscle preservation during Phase 1: The Forge. The integration of intermittent fasting provides metabolic optimization and strategic nutrient timing around training sessions. Every gram is calculated, every portion is weighed, and zero deviation is acceptable.

## **2.0 Daily Food Allocation (Non-Negotiable)**

### **2.1 Intermittent Fasting Framework**

- **Fasting Period:** Morning until lunch (~16-18 hours)
- **Eating Window:** Lunch to 6pm (~6 hours)
- **Meal Frequency:** 2 substantial meals
- **Strategic Purpose:** Enhanced fat oxidation, improved insulin sensitivity, nutrient timing optimization

### **2.2 Core Food Items**

**Meal 1 (Lunch/Pre-Gym):**

- **4 scrambled eggs** with **100g cottage cheese** and **200g spinach**
- **5 slices brown seeded bread** with margarine

**Meal 2 (6pm/Post-Gym):**

- **500g Greek yogurt**
- **2 chicken legs** (275g x 2 raw weight, skin-on)

### **2.3 Approved Beverages**

- **Coke Zero** (unlimited)
- **Black coffee** (unlimited)
- **Water** (minimum 2L daily)

## **3.0 Execution Standards**

### **3.1 Measurement Protocol**

- **All solid foods must be weighed** using digital kitchen scales
- **Zero deviation** from specified quantities and timing
- **Consistency is paramount** - same foods, same portions, every day
- **Fasting period integrity** - no calories during morning fast

### **3.2 Preparation Guidelines**

- **Eggs:** Scrambled with minimal oil/butter, mixed with cottage cheese and spinach
- **Cottage cheese:** Integrated with eggs during cooking
- **Spinach:** Fresh or frozen, steamed/sautéed, incorporated with eggs
- **Bread:** Toasted with margarine spread
- **Chicken legs:** Baked, grilled, or roasted with skin on
- **Greek yogurt:** Plain, no added sugars or flavoring

### **3.3 Meal Timing Protocol**

- **Meal 1 timing:** Lunch (pre-gym) - optimal carb and protein loading
- **Training window:** Post-meal 1, fueled by bread carbohydrates and egg protein
- **Meal 2 timing:** 6pm (post-gym) - recovery nutrition within optimal window
- **Fasting period:** 6pm to next day lunch - enhanced fat oxidation phase

## **4.0 Social Meal Protocol**

### **4.1 Substitution Rule**

- **"Substitution, Not Addition"** - Any social meal must **replace** an equivalent portion within the eating window
- **Maintain eating window** - Social meals must occur between lunch and 6pm
- **Preserve fasting period** - Morning fast remains non-negotiable

### **4.2 Damage Control Hierarchy**

1. **Timing Priority:** Maintain eating window and fasting period
2. **Protein Priority:** Ensure minimum protein targets are met regardless of substitution
3. **Portion Awareness:** Estimate portions as accurately as possible
4. **Return to Protocol:** Resume standard allocation the following day

## **5.0 Compliance Tracking**

### **5.1 Daily Adherence Standard**

- **95% compliance minimum** for mission success
- **Fasting integrity tracking** - morning fast duration and compliance
- **Track deviations** with reasons and adjustments
- **Zero tolerance** for consecutive days of non-compliance

### **5.2 Performance Indicators**

- **Daily adherence rate** including fasting compliance
- **Weekly average compliance**
- **Social meal frequency and impact**
- **Energy levels and recovery correlation**
- **Training performance correlation**

## **6.0 Strategic Purpose**

### **6.1 Enhanced Caloric Deficit**

- **Daily caloric intake:** ~2965 calories
- **Estimated deficit:** ~635 calories daily
- **Fat loss projection:** 0.6kg/week sustainable rate
- **Intermittent fasting synergy:** Extended fat oxidation periods

### **6.2 Protein Target**

- **Daily protein delivery:** ~184g (revised allocation)
- **Minimum threshold:** 180g (exceeded by 4g safety margin)
- **High-quality complete proteins:** Eggs, cottage cheese, Greek yogurt, chicken legs

### **6.3 Nutrient Timing Optimization**

- **Pre-workout carbs:** Bread provides glycogen for training intensity
- **Pre-workout protein:** Eggs and cottage cheese support muscle protein synthesis
- **Post-workout recovery:** Complete meal within optimal recovery window
- **Fasting benefits:** Enhanced autophagy, improved insulin sensitivity

### **6.4 Micronutrient Support**

- **Spinach:** Iron, folate, vitamins A/C/K, nitrates for performance
- **Eggs:** B-vitamins, choline, essential amino acids
- **Greek yogurt:** Calcium, probiotics, additional protein
- **Intermittent fasting:** Enhanced nutrient partitioning and absorption

## **7.0 Contingency Protocols**

### **7.1 Travel/Disruption Days**

- **Maintain fasting window:** Priority for metabolic benefits
- **Portable meal 1:** Pre-cooked eggs, protein powder alternative if needed
- **Portable meal 2:** Pre-cooked chicken legs, Greek yogurt cups
- **Timing flexibility:** Maintain 6-hour eating window, adjust clock times as needed

### **7.2 Training Schedule Disruptions**

- **Priority:** Maintain pre-training meal (meal 1) timing
- **Flexibility:** Post-training meal can shift within eating window
- **Fasting maintenance:** Preserve morning fasting period when possible

### **7.3 Supply Chain Issues**

- **Approved substitutions:**
    - Chicken breast for chicken legs (adjust quantity for protein equivalence)
    - Whole wheat bread for brown seeded bread
    - Low-fat cottage cheese for standard cottage cheese
- **Intermittent fasting maintenance:** Non-negotiable during substitutions

## **8.0 Performance Correlation**

### **8.1 Intermittent Fasting Adaptation**

- **Track fasting tolerance:** Energy levels during morning fasting period (1-10 scale)
- **Training performance:** Pre-workout meal effectiveness for gym sessions
- **Recovery assessment:** Post-workout meal timing and satiety correlation

### **8.2 Training Synchronization**

- **Pre-workout fuel:** Monitor bread and egg energy delivery for training intensity
- **Post-workout recovery:** Assess chicken and yogurt for muscle recovery
- **Strength maintenance:** Track performance correlation with enhanced deficit

### **8.3 Metabolic Indicators**

- **Daily energy ratings:** Correlation with fasting periods and eating windows
- **Sleep quality:** Impact of 6pm final meal on sleep onset and quality
- **Hunger management:** Satiety assessment within compressed eating window

**PROTOCOL STATUS:** Active (Revised August 8, 2025 - Intermittent Fasting Integration) **COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENT:** ≥95% Daily Adherence **REVIEW CYCLE:** Weekly assessment with Handler **MODIFICATION AUTHORITY:** Handler override only with data justification

**RECENT MODIFICATIONS:**

- **August 8, 2025 (Phase 1):** Reduced chicken allocation from 10 drumsticks (1kg) to 6 chicken legs (600g, skin-on) for budget optimization and enhanced caloric deficit while maintaining protein adequacy.
- **August 8, 2025 (Phase 2):** Implemented intermittent fasting protocol with rice elimination. Added 5th bread slice for pre-workout carbs, restructured to 2-meal system within 6-hour eating window. Enhanced deficit to ~635 calories daily while optimizing nutrient timing around training sessions.
