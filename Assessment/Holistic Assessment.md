## 1. Identity & Trajectory
You are in the midst of a long-term transformation, moving from a survival-driven weight crisis (160 kg, 2018) into a structured, disciplined pursuit of the **“functional warrior / muscular Viking”** archetype. The past six years show consistent phases of adaptation: diet-driven loss, activity foundation, structured strength training, and now accelerated recomposition. Your trajectory is clear: steady fat loss while retaining or increasing strength, with increasing emphasis on mobility, conditioning, and aesthetics.

## 10. Overall Assessment
You are a **high-discipline, data-driven operator** midway through a successful recomposition. Strength is well-developed, cardio capacity lags but improving. Nutrition and supplementation are tightly managed. Mobility is strong except for shoulders. Aesthetics are powerful but still raw; refinement in clothing, grooming, and body composition will sharpen the Viking archetype.  

Trajectory is positive, sustainable, and anchored by resilience and adaptability.
