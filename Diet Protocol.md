## **Key Points & Considerations**

- **Consistent daily meals** to simplify prep and budgeting while ensuring steady nutrient intake.
    
- Protein intake at ~225g supports muscle retention and growth despite aggressive fat loss.
    
- Carbs (~195g) timed pre- and post-workout with rice at night to optimize performance and recovery.
    
- Fats (~138g) primarily from avocado, chicken skin, eggs, and olive oil support hormonal health and satiety.
    
- Total calories (~3100 kcal) create a daily **deficit of ~500 kcal** against your estimated TDEE (~3600 kcal) — supporting steady fat loss at ~0.4–0.5kg/week.
    
- Incorporates your supplement stack (creatine, shilajit, Platinum Pump) which supports recovery and training capacity.
    
- Limited seasoning calories; no added sugars or processed foods.
    
- Strict weighing of foods to minimize variance.
    
- Drink unlimited water, black coffee, Coke Zero within fasting/eating windows.
